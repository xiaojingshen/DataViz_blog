Select only year 2019-2020 for import and export data sets and paste into a new sheet using Microsoft Excel. \r\n4.2 Import the two data sets into Tableau.\r\nConnection: Choose Extract to allow them to go public\r\n\r\n4.3 The first chart is showing the difference between 2019 and 2020.\r\nTo make a pyramid chart for import and export.Left chart as import and right chart as export.\r\nChange the data type for [Year] from number to date&time \r\nColumns: Put [Export] and [Import] value\r\nRows: Region \r\nColor: Year Edit color as opacity 66% \r\nEdit x- axis, to make two axis (export and import) face to each other, by reversing the scale of export.\r\n\r\nTo make year 2019 and 2020 stack to each other to compare easily, need to off the stack marks. \r\nFinal look \r\n4.4 The second chart is showing the trend between 2019 and 2020.\r\n\r\nColumns: Region, Month Rows: Sum by month Color: Export or Import\r\n\r\nDate change to Month\r\n\r\n4.5 Create new dashboard\r\n\r\n5.0 Major Observations\r\nMainland China is one of the major trade partners with Singapore which has largest value among the 6 regions for both export and import in year 2019 and year 2020.\r\nFor Malaysia, there is a sharp decline in both import and export in April 2020.From news, Statistician chief Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said the decrease was due to the shutdown of most of the national economic sectors since the enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. [Sharp decline in Malaysia’s exports | New Straits Times, 2021] (https://www.nst.com.my/business/2020/06/597855/sharp-decline-malaysias-exports)\\\r\nThere is a sharp decrease in May 2020 for US import value. The declines due to the impact of COVID-19, as many businesses were operating at limited capacity or ceased operations completely, and the movement of travelers across borders was restricted. U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services, May 2020\r\nTaiwan and Hong Kong both import and export are increasing from 2019 to 2020, with a continuous increasing trend.\r\nHong Kong has the second highest in export value but the last for the import value. The Import value is only about 1/10 of Mainland China.\r\nJapan Import and export value are almost equivalent in 2019 and 2020, which is relatively stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
