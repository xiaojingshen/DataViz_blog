Also, the title as ‘six countries’ but some of them are only regions instead of countries.\r\nIn raw data, the trade amount is with unit as ‘thousand dollars’, the chart did not mention.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nThe tick line for y-axis is not obvious.\r\nThere are two y-axes with different scale, it’ s not possible to put them together to do comparison.\r\nTo show the time-serious trend line instead of the area chart which is hard to see the trade amount changing along the time.\r\nThere is clear indication of data source stated in the chart.\r\nThere is no clear indication of month in the y-axis.\r\nEach chart is too narrow to show the message of monthly data.\r\n2.0 Alternative design\r\n\r\nIn order to clearly compare difference between 2019 and 2020 and in export and import value and trend chart, 2 individual charts as show in the initial visualization.\r\nAll charts with title and subtitle to explain key words and definitions will be showing in graph.\r\nY-axis are unified to do comparison in the same scale for different years and different trading methods.\r\n3.0 Proposed Visualization\r\nData Visualization can be found in Tableau Public Server: Dashboard\r\n4.0 Step-by-step Guide\r\n4.1 Data preparation\r\nSelect only data for 6 regions, Filter variables = ‘Hongkong, Mainland China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, US’. Select only year 2019-2020 for import and export data sets and paste into a new sheet using Microsoft Excel. \r\n4.2 Import the two data sets into Tableau.\r\nConnection: Choose Extract to allow them to go public\r\n\r\n4.3 The first chart is showing the difference between 2019 and 2020. Left chart as import\r\nand right chart as export. (1) Change the data type for [Year] from number to date&time \r\nColumns: Drug [Export] and [Import] value\r\nRows: Region \r\nColor: Year Edit color as opacity 66% \r\nEdit x- axis, to make two axis (export and import) face to each other, by reversing the scale of export.\r\n\r\nTo make year 2019 and 2020 stack to each other to compare easily, need to off the stack marks. \r\nFinal look \r\n4.4 The second chart is showing the trend between 2019 and 2020.\r\n\r\nColumns: Region, Month Rows: Sum by month Color: Export or Import\r\n\r\nDate change to Month\r\n\r\n4.5 Create new dashboard\r\n\r\n5.0 Major Observations\r\nMainland China has largest value among the 6 regions for export and import in 2019 and 2020.\r\nTaiwan and Hong Kong both import and export are increasing from 2019 to 2020, with a continuous up trend.\r\nFor Malaysia, there is a sharp decline in both import and export in April 2020.From news, Statistician chief Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said the decrease was due to the shutdown of most of the national economic sectors since the enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. (Sharp decline in Malaysia’s exports | New Straits Times, 2021)\r\nHong Kong has the second highest in export value but the last for the import value. The Import value is only about 1/10 of Mainland China.\r\nJapan Import and export value are almost equivalent in 2019 and 2020, which is relatively stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
